### New Features
* The app now has a custom icon.
* Platform-specific installers with bundled Java runtime [#428](https://github.com/mlopatkin/andlogview/issues/428).
  There is no need to install JDK manually if you use one of these. So far, these platforms are supported:
  * Linux (amd64), only for DEB-based distributions, e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint ([#437](https://github.com/mlopatkin/andlogview/issues/437)).

  Users on other platforms should continue use the `noJRE` distribution with manually installed JDK for now.
