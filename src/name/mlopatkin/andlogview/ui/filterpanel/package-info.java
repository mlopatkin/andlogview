/**
 * The bottom panel that can be used to create/delete/toggle filters.
 * <p>
 * Embedder pushes data via an instance of the
 * {@link name.mlopatkin.andlogview.ui.filterpanel.FilterPanelModel}.
 * <p>
 * Overall architecture of the panel is quite complicated. FilterPanel holds buttons. Each button corresponds to the
 * instance of the {@link name.mlopatkin.andlogview.ui.filterpanel.PanelFilterView}. Toggling button
 * or selecting context menu action is translated to a call to FilterPanelModel. FilterPanelModel maintains a mapping
 * of PanelFilterViews to {@link name.mlopatkin.andlogview.ui.filterpanel.PanelFilter}s. Each method call translate to
 * call to PanelFilter's method. PanelFilter is provided by the embedder, and it will change internal
 * state of the filter model. Then embedder will then change state of the FilterPanelModel via its public method.
