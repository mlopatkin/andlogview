 * This class is responsible for scrolling a table when new records are added

 * insertion.

 * The usage pattern is following: whenever you want to insert a record or
 * change size of the table call {@link #notifyBeforeInsert()} before your
 * action. If you aren't inserting something you should call
 * {@link #scrollIfNeeded()} after your action.
