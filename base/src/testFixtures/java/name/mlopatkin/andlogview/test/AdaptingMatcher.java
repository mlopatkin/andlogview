/**
 * Utility class that helps to write custom matchers for object properties. If you have a method of an object that
 * returns a particular type for which a built-in matcher is available then you can combine the method reference and
 * this built-in matcher in this class.
 * <p/>
 * There is equivalence between {@code assertThat(adapter(foo), matchesSomething())} and
 * {@code assertThat(foo, new AdaptingMatcher<>(adapter, matchesSomething()))} but the latter is more versatile: it
 * can be used as an argument for another matcher.
 *
 * @param <T> the type to run matcher on
 * @param <R> the type of the method
